# Claromentis PHP Developer Test

It was test task for[Claromentis](https://www.claromentis.com).

The task is to run some calculations and display result based on data from an uploaded CSV file. CSV stands for comma separated values â€“ format supported by Excel or any other spreadsheets software.
The source data is an imaginary expenses report and the goal of the programme is to display total cost per expense category.
Once the summary data has been calculated and displayed, it should be possible to generate and download a CSV file with the same data as displayed in the table.
Example page layout is shown on the screenshot.

**File format**: the expected source file does not have any headers, and contain the following three columns:
- **category**. String. May be one of a few values, not defined in advance (the set of available values can be different in different CSV files)
- **price**. Numeric. Cost per item
- **amount**. Numeric. Number of items

![Plain](/images/plain_text.png?raw=true "Plain")

The resulting pages should be fully valid XHTML or HTML5.
